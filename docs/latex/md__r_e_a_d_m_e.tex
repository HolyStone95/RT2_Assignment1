This branch contains the same package of the action branch slightly modified and the documentation is done using {\bfseries{Doxygen}}. In addition two {\bfseries{Jupyter}} notebook are being added in the {\bfseries{notebook}} folder in order to implement a G\+UI to better and easily control the robot in the simulation. The one called {\itshape final\+\_\+assignment} is the complete and commented user interface, while notebook called text is to show that the plot regarding velocities wroks but they do not in {\itshape final\+\_\+assignment} notebook, do not know why.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Launch the node}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
To launch the node, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 action\_branch.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


Once the nodes are launched start the Jupyter notebook in order to use the enhanced interface for controlling the robot\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Additional documentation}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}

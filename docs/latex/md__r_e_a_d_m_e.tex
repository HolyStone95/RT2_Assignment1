The \href{https://github.com/CarmineD8/rt2_assignment1}{\texttt{ Professor\textquotesingle{}s package}} has been modified by creating this repository, containing the given package and two additional branches\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily actions}
\item {\ttfamily ros2}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Finally, in the main branch (or in one of the two added branches), I added a Vrep scene containing the robot interacting with the simulation. (You can choose if using R\+OS or R\+O\+S2 api)\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{More about the \char`\"{}\+\_\+actions\+\_\+\char`\"{} branch}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
This branch contains the same package of the main branch, but with the {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}}}} node modelled as a R\+OS action server, instead of a “simple” server. Given that, {\bfseries{the robot F\+SM node}} should now implement mechanisms for possibly cancelling the goal, when the related user command is received\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{More about the \char`\"{}\+\_\+ros2\+\_\+\char`\"{} branch}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
In the branch {\ttfamily ros2}, the cpp nodes (Robot F\+SM and position server) has been written for R\+O\+S2, as {\bfseries{components}}, or composable nodes. By using the {\bfseries{ros1\+\_\+bridge}}, they can be linked with the respective R\+OS nodes and with the simulation in Gazebo. {\bfseries{The \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}}}} behaviour is still implemented as a service. Also\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item I\textquotesingle{}ve written a launch file to start the container manager and all the nodes as components.
\item a script to launch all required nodes and the simulation has also been implemented

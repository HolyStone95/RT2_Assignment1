In the branch {\ttfamily ros2}, the cpp nodes (Robot F\+SM and position server) has been written for R\+O\+S2, as {\bfseries{components}}, or composable nodes. The file {\bfseries{mapping\+\_\+rules.\+yaml}} will allow, using the {\bfseries{ros1\+\_\+bridge}} package, to create a link with the respective R\+OS nodes and with the simulation in Gazebo. {\bfseries{The go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}} behaviour is still implemented as a service.

Also\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item I\textquotesingle{}ve written a {\itshape {\bfseries{script}}} to start the container manager and all the nodes as components.
\item a {\itshape {\bfseries{launch file}}} to launch all required nodes and the simulation has also been implemented

To launch the nodes as components in a container, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ros2 launch rt2\_assignment1 composable\_launch.py}
\end{DoxyCode}


To instead launch them as nodes and to launch Gazebo simulation, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ros2 launch rt2\_assignment1 ros2.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}

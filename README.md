This branch contains the same package of the action branch slightly modified and the documentation is done using **Sphinx**. In addition a **Jupyter** notebook is being added in the **notebook** folder in order to implement a GUI to better and easily control the robot in the simulation.

## Launch the node 

To launch the node, please run:
```
roslaunch rt2_assignment1 action_branch.launch
```
Once the nodes are launched start the Jupyter notebook in order to use the enhanced interface for controlling the robot
